# convex_hull_algorithms
1st/2 Assignment of the "Computational Geometry" course (Spring Semester 2023 - NKUA). Python implementations of the following algorithms to compute the convex hull of N-points: Incremental (Graham's Scan) (2D and 3D), Quickhull (2D and 3D), Divide and Conquer (2D), Gift Wrapping (2D).

## how to execute
Run each Python file and see the results. Code comments explain anything you need to understand the code. Keep in mind that in some
executions you will have interaction with the terminal, by inputing some data for the code to run.
